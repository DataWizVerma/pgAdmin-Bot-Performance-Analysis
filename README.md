# Bot Performance Analysis ðŸ“Š

A real-time analysis project using SQL Mentor datasets, designed to help beginners understand SQL querying and performance analysis. In this project, you will analyze user performance by creating and querying a table of user submissions. The goal is to solve a series of SQL problems to extract meaningful insights from user data.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing data related to a bot that logs SQL question attempts. By querying this data, we can gain insights into user performance, patterns in submission behavior, and more.

## Problem Statements

1. **List All Distinct Users and Their Stats**  
   - **Description:** Return the user name, total submissions, and total points earned by each user.  
   - **Expected Output:** A list of users with their submission count and total points.

2. **Calculate the Daily Average Points for Each User**  
   - **Description:** For each day, calculate the average points earned by each user.  
   - **Expected Output:** A report showing the average points per user for each day.

3. **Find the Top 3 Users with the Most Correct Submissions for Each Day**  
   - **Description:** Identify the top 3 users with the most correct submissions for each day.  
   - **Expected Output:** A list of users and their correct submissions, ranked daily.

4. **Find the Top 5 Users with the Highest Number of Incorrect Submissions**  
   - **Description:** Identify the top 5 users with the highest number of incorrect submissions.  
   - **Expected Output:** A list of users with the count of incorrect submissions.

5. **Find the Top 10 Performers for Each Week**  
   - **Description:** Identify the top 10 users with the highest total points earned each week.  
   - **Expected Output:** A report showing the top 10 users ranked by total points per week.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- **SQL Grouping and Aggregation:** Deepen understanding of grouping data and calculating metrics like average, count, and sum.
- **Using CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Learn how to use CTEs to structure complex queries in a more readable format.
- **Window Functions:** Understand how to use window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` and `RANK()` to rank users based on their performance.
- **Time-based Analysis:** Gain experience in analyzing time-based data, including daily and weekly metrics.
